# BIA-IoMT-Cyber-HES24
A repository for exploring Bio-Inspired Algorithms (BIA) in cybersecurity, applying them to the IoMT 2024 dataset as part of a Data Science Master's project at HES, culminating in December 2024. The repository includes all necessary scripts to reproduce the work presented in the paper, including data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, model training and evaluation, and performance benchmarking against traditional methods.

**Authors:** Alex Coward, Dmitry Gavrilkoff, Jessica Kotini, Greg Meinert, Christopher Tam

**Dataset:** the CIC IoMT 2024 Dataset, prepared by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC), contains labeled network traffic data simulating IoMT devices and cyberattacks, supporting research in threat detection and algorithm development (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iomt-dataset-2024.html). A combined dataset containing both training and test subsets is available for download in CSV and/or Parquet formats on Kaggle for convenience: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/limamateus/cic-iomt-2024-wifi-mqtt
